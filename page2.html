        My Love, My Desire, My Favorite Sin,<br><br>

        Happy Birthday, baby. 🎂🔥 If I were there right now, you wouldn’t be reading this—you’d be too distracted to even think about words. But since distance is keeping me from doing all the things I should be doing to you, let’s just say this letter is my way of making sure you still feel me.<br><br>
        I want you to close your eyes for a moment and imagine this: my lips trailing down your skin, my breath warm against your ear as I whisper all the very bad things I plan on doing when I finally see you again. My hands moving so slowly, just to tease you—because you know I love watching you lose control. 😏</br><br>
        I’d take my sweet, sweet time, drawing out every second, making you crave me just the way I crave you every damn day. And just when you think you can’t take another second of waiting… I’d make you wait a little longer. Because the best things, my love, are always worth the torture. 😘🔥<br><br>
        So until I can finish what I started, wrap yourself up—literally. A satin robe, lace, or even a giant bow (get creative 😉), and just know that when the time comes, I’ll be there, ready to make sure you get the best birthday present ever. And trust me, baby, I’ll take my time giving it to you. 😏<br><br>
        <strong>Yours, breathlessly, recklessly, and completely,</strong><br>
        Slutty Wife 💋
